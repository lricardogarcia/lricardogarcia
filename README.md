👋 Hi, I'm Luiz Ricardo Garcia
Backend Engineer focused on Internal Systems, Data Integrity & Metrics

I design and build practical internal systems that replace spreadsheets, manual workflows and unreliable reporting.
My focus is on clean architecture, strong data modeling, auditability and automated metrics — software that companies actually trust to run daily operations.

📍 Based in Brazil 🇧🇷
🌍 Open to remote roles in Europe

🧠 What I Build (and Why)

I work on backend systems where correctness and clarity matter more than hype:

Internal operational systems (not public SaaS demos)

Backend-driven dashboards and indicators

Explicit business rules and permissions

Historical consistency and audit trails

Automation through background jobs

This is the type of software commonly found in Nordic and European companies: quiet, reliable and well-structured.

🧱 Core Tech Stack
🐍 Backend & Systems

Python 3.12

Django (authentication, ORM, admin, templates)

PostgreSQL (relational modeling, reporting, aggregation)

Service-layer architecture (no business logic in views)

⚙️ Data & Automation

Advanced SQL (aggregations, metrics, trends)

Celery + Redis for async jobs and scheduled tasks

Snapshot-based metrics and historical indicators

📊 Visualization (Backend-first)

Django Templates

Chart.js

Server-side rendering for simplicity and speed

🐳 Development & Infra

Docker & Docker Compose

Git & GitHub

Linux-based development environment

🚀 Featured Project
🏢 InternalOps — Operational Management System

📌 A realistic internal system built to replace Excel-based operations

InternalOps is a backend-focused web application that centralizes operational records and automatically generates reliable indicators for decision-making.

This project was designed to reflect real internal software used by companies, not portfolio-style demo apps.

---
🔑 Key Features

Role-based access control (Admin / Manager / Viewer)

Operational records with lifecycle control (pending, confirmed, canceled)

Category management with historical integrity

Full audit log with structured change tracking

Automated financial and operational metrics

Background jobs for recalculation and monthly snapshots

Simple, fast dashboard focused on clarity, not visuals

---
🧠 Engineering Decisions

Strong domain modeling (Operations, Categories, Audit Logs)

Soft deletes instead of physical removal

Metrics calculated at database/service level

No heavy logic in the frontend

Async processing to protect request performance

Stack: Python · Django · PostgreSQL · Celery · Redis · Docker

---
🏗️ Architecture Principles

Apps separated by domain

Thin views, explicit service layers

Clear ownership of business rules

Data integrity over shortcuts

Readable code over clever abstractions

These principles align well with Nordic engineering culture, where maintainability and correctness are key.

---
📌 What I’m Looking For

Backend roles focused on internal systems

Teams that value clean code and data reliability

Products supporting real operational workflows

English-speaking, international environments

Companies in Finland, the Netherlands or Ireland
