## Backend Software Engineer — Internal Systems & Data Platforms

I build **reliable backend systems** that replace spreadsheets and manual workflows with auditable, production-grade software.

My work focuses on **data integrity, clear business rules, and long-lived systems** used daily by non-technical teams.

📍 Brazil  
🌍 Open to remote roles (EU / UK friendly)

## What I Work On

- Backend systems for internal and operational platforms
- Business-driven data modeling and persistence
- Audit logs, historical consistency, and traceability
- APIs and background processing for automation
- Metrics and indicators to support decision-making
- Maintaining and evolving systems already running in production

This is not demo code. These systems support real workflows.

## Featured Project

### InternalOps — Operational Management Platform

Backend-centric internal system designed to replace Excel-based controls and manual reporting.

**Key characteristics**
- Role-based access control (Admin / Manager / Viewer)
- Operational records with explicit lifecycle states
- Soft deletes and historical preservation
- Full audit trail with field-level change history
- Automated indicators and monthly snapshots
- Asynchronous jobs for heavy processing and reporting
- Designed for maintainability and long-term evolution

**Stack**
Python · Django · PostgreSQL · Celery · Redis · Docker

## Engineering Principles

- Simple solutions over clever ones
- Explicit business rules over implicit behavior
- Data consistency before feature velocity
- Systems should be boring, predictable, and reliable
- If it’s in production, it must be observable and auditable
